weight, facial features, sound of your voice, hair length,
coloration, and distinguishing characteristics, if any.
You can make yourself appear as a m em ber of another

Natural Weapons. You grow claws, fangs, spines,
horns, or a different natural w eapon of your choice. Your

have a +1 bonus to the attack and damage rolls you
make using it.

by you for the spell’s duration. If you or one of your

2nd-level enchantment (ritual)<br>
Casting Time: 1 action<br>
Range: 30 feet<br>
Components: V, S, M (a m orsel of food)<br>
Duration: 24 hours<br>
By m eans of this spell, you use an animal to deliver a
message. Choose a Tiny beast you can see within range,
such as a squirrel, a blue jay, or a bat. You specify a
location, which you must have visited, and a recipient
w ho matches a general description, such as “a man or
w om an dressed in the uniform of the town guard” or “a
red-haired dw arf w earing a pointed hat.” You also speak
a m essage of up to twenty-five words. The target beast
travels for the duration of the spell toward the specified
location, covering about 50 m iles per 24 hours for a
flying messenger, or 25 m iles for other animals.
When the m essenger arrives, it delivers your m essage
to the creature that you described, replicating the sound
of your voice. The m essenger speaks only to a creature
matching the description you gave. If the m essenger
doesn’t reach its destination before the spell ends, the
m essage is lost, and the beast m akes its way back to

A n i m a l  S h a p e s<br>
8 th-level transmutation<br>
Casting Time: 1 action<br>
Range: 30 feet<br>
Components: V, S<br>
Duration: Concentration, up to 24 hours<br>
Your m agic turns others into beasts. Choose any
number of willing creatures that you can see within
range. You transform each target into the form of a
Large or sm aller beast with a challenge rating of 4 or
lower. On subsequent turns, you can use your action to
transform affected creatures into new forms.
The transformation lasts for the duration for each
target, or until the target drops to 0 hit points or dies.
You can choose a different form for each target. A
target’s game statistics are replaced by the statistics of
the chosen beast, though the target retains its alignment
and Intelligence, W isdom , and Charisma scores. The
target assum es the hit points of its new form, and when
it reverts to its norm al form, it returns to the number
of hit points it had before it transformed. If it reverts as
a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage
carries over to its normal form. As long as the excess
damage doesn’t reduce the creature’s norm al form to 0
hit points, it isn’t knocked unconscious. The creature is
limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its
new form, and it can’t speak or cast spells.
The target’s gear melds into the new form. The target
can’t activate, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of
its equipment.

A n i m a t e  D e a d
3rd-level necromancy
Casting Time: 1 minute
Range: 10 feet
Components: V, S, M (a drop of blood, a piece of flesh,
and a pinch of bone dust)
Duration: Instantaneous
This spell creates an undead servant. Choose a pile
of bones or a corpse of a M edium or Sm all humanoid
within range. Your spell im bues the target with a foul
m im icry of life, raising it as an undead creature. The
target becom es a skeleton if you chose bones or a
zom bie if you chose a corpse (the DM has the creature’s
game statistics).
On each of your turns, you can use a bonus action
to mentally com m and any creature you made with
this spell if the creature is within 60 feet of you (if you
control multiple creatures, you can com m and any or all
of them at the sam e time, issuing the sam e com m and to
each one). You decide what action the creature will take
and where it w ill move during its next turn, or you can
issue a general com m and, such as to guard a particular
cham ber or corridor. If you issue no com m ands, the
creature only defends itself against hostile creatures.
O nce given an order, the creature continues to follow it
until its task is complete.
The creature is under your control for 24 hours,
after which it stops obeying any com m and you’ve given
it. To maintain control of the creature for another
24 hours, you must cast this spell on the creature
again before the current 24-hour period ends. This
use of the spell reasserts your control over up to four
creatures you have animated with this spell, rather than
animating a new one.
A t Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
spell slot of 4th level or higher, you animate or reassert
control over two additional undead creatures for each
slot level above 3rd. Each of the creatures must com e
from a different corpse or pile of bones.

A n i m a t e  O b j e c t s
5th-level transmutation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 120 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Objects com e to life at your com m and. Choose up to
ten nonm agical objects within range that are not being
w orn or carried. M edium targets count as two objects,
Large targets count as four objects, Huge targets
count as eight objects. You can’t animate any object
larger than Huge. Each target animates and becom es a
creature under your control until the spell ends or until
reduced to 0 hit points.
As a bonus action, you can mentally com m and any
creature you made with this spell if the creature is
within 500 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures,
you can com m and any or all of them at the sam e time,
issuing the sam e com m and to each one). You decide
what action the creature w ill take and w here it will
move during its next turn, or you can issue a general
com m and, such as to guard a particular cham ber or
corridor. If you issue no com m ands, the creature only
defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given
an order, the creature continues to follow it until its
task is complete.

A n i m a t e d  O b j e c t  S t a t i s t i c s
Size HP AC Attack Str Dex
Tiny 20 18 +8 to hit, 1d4 + 4 damage 4 18
Small 25 16 +6 to hit, 1d8 + 2 damage 6 14
Medium 40 13 +5 to hit, 2d6 + 1 damage 10 12
Large 50 10 +6 to hit, 2d10 + 2 damage 14 10
Huge 80 10 +8 to hit, 2d12 + 4 damage 18 6
An animated object is a construct with AC, hit points,
attacks, Strength, and Dexterity determined by its size.
Its Constitution is 10 and its Intelligence and W isdom
are 3, and its Charisma is 1. Its speed is 30 feet; if the
object lacks legs or other appendages it can use for
locom otion, it instead has a flying speed of 30 feet and
can hover. If the object is securely attached to a surface
or a larger object, such as a chain bolted to a wall, its
speed is 0. It has blindsight with a radius of 30 feet and
is blind beyond that distance. When the animated object
drops to 0 hit points, it reverts to its original object
form, and any remaining damage carries over to its
original object form.
If you com m and an object to attack, it can make a
single melee attack against a creature within 5 feet
of it. It m akes a slam attack with an attack bonus and
bludgeoning damage determined by its size. The DM
might rule that a specific object inflicts slashing or
piercing damage based on its form.
At Higher Levels. If you cast this spell using a
spell slot of 6th level or higher, you can animate two
additional objects for each slot level above 5th.

A n t i l i f e  S h e l l
5th-level abjuration
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self (10-foot radius)
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
A shim m ering barrier extends out from you in a 10-foot
radius and m oves with you, remaining centered on
you and hedging out creatures other than undead and
constructs. The barrier lasts for the duration.
The barrier prevents an affected creature from
passing or reaching through. An affected creature
can cast spells or make attacks with ranged or reach
w eapons through the barrier.
If you move so that an affected creature is forced to
pass through the barrier, the spell ends.
</p></div></div><div hidden id="spell_antimagic_field"><div id="spell"><p>
A n t i m a g i c  F i e l d
8 th-level abjuration
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self (10-foot-radius sphere)
Components: V, S, M (a pinch of pow dered iron or
iron filings)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
A 10-foot-radius invisible sphere of antimagic surrounds
you. This area is divorced from the magical energy that
suffuses the multiverse. W ithin the sphere, spells can’t
be cast, sum m oned creatures disappear, and even m agic
items becom e mundane. Until the spell ends, the sphere
m oves with you, centered on you.
Spells and other magical effects, except those created
by an artifact or a deity, are suppressed in the sphere
and can’t protrude into it. A slot expended to cast
a suppressed spell is consum ed. While an effect is
suppressed, it doesn’t function, but the time it spends
suppressed counts against its duration.
Targeted Effects. Spells and other magical effects,
such as magic missile and charm person, that target
a creature or an object in the sphere have no effect
on that target.
Areas of Magic. The area of another spell or magical
effect, such as fireball, can’t extend into the sphere.
If the sphere overlaps an area of magic, the part of
the area that is covered by the sphere is suppressed.
For example, the flames created by a wall of fire are
suppressed within the sphere, creating a gap in the wall
if the overlap is large enough.
Spells. Any active spell or other magical effect on a
creature or an object in the sphere is suppressed while
the creature or object is in it.
Magic Items. The properties and pow ers of
m agic items are suppressed in the sphere. For
example, a + 1 longsword in the sphere functions as a
nonm agical longsword.
A m agic w eapon’s properties and pow ers are
suppressed if it is used against a target in the sphere or
wielded by an attacker in the sphere. If a m agic w eapon
or a piece of magic ammunition fully leaves the sphere
(for example, if you fire a m agic arrow or throw a magic
spear at a target outside the sphere), the m agic of the
item ceases to be suppressed as soon as it exits.
Magical Travel. Teleportation and planar travel
fail to w ork in the sphere, whether the sphere is the
destination or the departure point for such magical
travel. A portal to another location, world, or plane of
existence, as well as an opening to an extradim ensional
space such as that created by the rope trick spell,
temporarily closes while in the sphere.
Creatures and Objects. A creature or object
sum m oned or created by m agic temporarily w inks out
of existence in the sphere. Such a creature instantly
reappears once the space the creature occupied is no
longer within the sphere.
Dispel Magic. Spells and magical effects such as
dispel magic have no effect on the sphere. Likewise, the
spheres created by different antimagic field spells don’t
nullify each other.

A n t i p a t h y / S y m p a t h y
8 th-level enchantment
Casting Time: 1 hour
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S, M (either a lump of alum soaked in
vinegar for the antipathy effect or a drop of honey for
the sympathy effect)
Duration: 10 days
This spell attracts or repels creatures of your choice.
You target som ething within range, either a Huge or
sm aller object or creature or an area that is no larger
than a 200-foot cube. Then specify a kind of intelligent
creature, such as red dragons, goblins, or vampires.
You invest the target with an aura that either attracts or
repels the specified creatures for the duration. Choose
antipathy or sympathy as the aura’s effect.
Antipathy. The enchantment causes creatures of the
kind you designated to feel an intense urge to leave the
area and avoid the target. When such a creature can
see the target or com es within 60 feet of it, the creature
must succeed on a W isdom saving throw or becom e
frightened. The creature remains frightened while it can
see the target or is within 60 feet of it. While frightened
by the target, the creature must use its movement to
move to the nearest safe spot from which it can’t see
the target. If the creature m oves m ore than 60 feet from
the target and can’t see it, the creature is no longer
frightened, but the creature becom es frightened again if
it regains sight of the target or m oves within 60 feet of it.
Sympathy. The enchantment causes the specified
creatures to feel an intense urge to approach the target
while within 60 feet of it or able to see it. When such a
creature can see the target or com es within 60 feet of it,
the creature must succeed on a W isdom saving throw or
use its movement on each of its turns to enter the area
or move within reach of the target. When the creature
has done so, it can’t willingly m ove away from the target.
If the target dam ages or otherwise harms an affected
creature, the affected creature can make a W isdom
saving throw to end the effect, as described below.
Ending the Effect. If an affected creature ends its
turn while not within 60 feet of the target or able to see
it, the creature m akes a W isdom saving throw. On a
successful save, the creature is no longer affected by
the target and recognizes the feeling of repugnance or
attraction as magical. In addition, a creature affected by
the spell is allowed another W isdom saving throw every
24 hours while the spell persists.
A creature that successfully saves against this effect
is im mune to it for 1 minute, after which time it can be
affected again.

A r c a n e  E y e
4th-level divination
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S, M (a bit of bat fur)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
You create an invisible, magical eye within range that
hovers in the air for the duration.
You mentally receive visual information from the eye,
which has norm al vision and darkvision out to 30 feet.
The eye can look in every direction.
A s an action, you can move the eye up to 30 feet in
any direction. There is no limit to how far away from
you the eye can move, but it can’t enter another plane
of existence. A solid barrier blocks the eye’s movement,
but the eye can pass through an opening as small as 1
inch in diameter.
</p></div></div><div hidden id="spell_abjuration"><div id="spell"><p>
A r c a n e  G a t e
6 th-level conjuration
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 500 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
You create linked teleportation portals that remain open
for the duration. Choose two points on the ground that
you can see, one point within 10 feet of you and one
point within 500 feet of you. A circular portal, 10 feet
in diameter, opens over each point. If the portal w ould
open in the space occupied by a creature, the spell fails,
and the casting is lost.
The portals are two-dimensional glowing rings
filled with mist, hovering inches from the ground and
perpendicular to it at the points you choose. A ring is
visible only from one side (your choice), which is the side
that functions as a portal.
Any creature or object entering the portal exits from
the other portal as if the two were adjacent to each
other; passing through a portal from the nonportal side
has no effect. The mist that fills each portal is opaque
and blocks vision through it. On your turn, you can
rotate the rings as a bonus action so that the active side
faces in a different direction.

2nd-level abjuration
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M (gold dust w orth at least 25 gp,

Duration: Until dispelled
You touch a closed door, window, gate, chest, or other
entryway, and it becom es locked for the duration. You
and the creatures you designate when you cast this
spell can open the object normally. You can also set a
passw ord that, when spoken within 5 feet of the object,
suppresses this spell for 1 minute. Otherwise, it is
im passable until it is broken or the spell is dispelled or
suppressed. Casting knock on the object suppresses
arcane lock for 10 minutes.
While affected by this spell, the object is m ore difficult
to break or force open; the DC to break it or pick any
locks on it increases by 10.

A protective m agical force surrounds you, manifesting
as a spectral frost that covers you and your gear.
You gain 5 tem porary hit points for the duration. If a
creature hits you with a melee attack while you have
these hit points, the creature takes 5 cold damage.

You invoke the pow er of Hadar, the Dark Hunger.
Tendrils of dark energy erupt from you and batter all
creatures within 10 feet of you. Each creature in that
area must m ake a Strength saving throw. On a failed
save, a target takes 2d6 necrotic damage and can’t take
reactions until its next turn. On a successful save, the

A s t r a l  P r o j e c t i o n
9th-level necromancy
Casting Time: 1 hour
Range: 10 feet
Components: V, S, M (for each creature you affect with
this spell, you must provide one jacinth worth at least
1,000 gp and one ornately carved bar of silver worth
at least 100 gp, all of which the spell consum es)
Duration: Special
You and up to eight willing creatures within range
project your astral bodies into the Astral Plane (the
spell fails and the casting is wasted if you are already
on that plane). The material body you leave behind is
u nconscious and in a state of suspended animation; it
doesn’t need food or air and doesn’t age.
Your astral body resem bles your m ortal form in
alm ost every way, replicating your game statistics and
possessions. The principal difference is the addition of
a silvery cord that extends from between your shoulder
blades and trails behind you, fading to invisibility after
1 foot. This cord is your tether to your material body. As
long as the tether remains intact, you can find your way
home. If the cord is cut—som ething that can happen
only when an effect specifically states that it does—your
soul and body are separated, killing you instantly.
Your astral form can freely travel through the Astral
Plane and can pass through portals there leading to any
other plane. If you enter a new plane or return to the
plane you were on when casting this spell, your body and
possessions are transported along the silver cord, allowing
you to re-enter your body as you enter the new plane.
Your astral form is a separate incarnation. Any damage
or other effects that apply to it have no effect on your
physical body, nor do they persist when you return to it.
The spell ends for you and your com panions when
you use your action to dism iss it. When the spell ends,
the affected creature returns to its physical body,
and it awakens.
The spell might also end early for you or one of your
com panions. A successful dispel magic spell used
against an astral or physical body ends the spell for that
creature. If a creature’s original body or its astral form
drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends for that creature. If
the spell ends and the silver cord is intact, the cord pulls
the creature’s astral form back to its body, ending its
state of suspended animation.
If you are returned to your body prematurely, your
com panions remain in their astral form s and must find
their own way back to their bodies, usually by dropping
to 0 hit points.

You create a Large hand of shimmering, translucent

The hand is an object that has AC 20 and hit points
equal to your hit point maximum. If it drops to 0 hit
points, the spell ends. It has a Strength of 26 (+8) and a
Dexterity of 10 (+0). The hand doesn’t fill its space.
When you cast the spell and as a bonus action on your
subsequent turns, you can move the hand up to 60 feet
and then cause one of the follow ing effects with it.
Clenched Fist. The hand strikes one creature or
object within 5 feet of it. Make a melee spell attack for
the hand using your game statistics. On a hit, the target
takes 4d8 force damage.
Forceful Hand. The hand attempts to push a creature

so, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to 2d6 +
your spellcasting ability modifier.
Interposing Hand. The hand interposes itself
between you and a creature you choose until you give
the hand a different com m and. The hand m oves to stay
between you and the target, providing you with half
cover against the target. The target can't move through
the hand’s space if its Strength score is less than or
equal to the hand’s Strength score. If its Strength score
is higher than the hand’s Strength score, the target can

C o n t r o l  W a t e r
4th-level transmutation
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 300 feet
Components: V, S , M (a drop of water and a
pinch of dust)
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
Until the spell ends, you control any freestanding water
inside an area you choose that is a cube up to 100 feet
on a side. You can choose from any of the following
effects when you cast this spell. As an action on your
turn, you can repeat the sam e effect or choose a
different one.
Flood. You cause the water level of all standing water in
the area to rise by as much as 20 feet. If the area includes
a shore, the flooding water spills over onto dry land.
If you choose an area in a large body of water, you
instead create a 20-foot tall wave that travels from one
side of the area to the other and then crashes down. Any
Huge or smaller vehicles in the wave’s path are carried
with it to the other side. Any Huge or smaller vehicles
struck by the wave have a 25 percent chance of capsizing.
The water level remains elevated until the spell ends
or you choose a different effect. If this effect produced
a wave, the wave repeats on the start of your next turn
while the flood effect lasts.
Part Water. You cause water in the area to move
apart and create a trench. The trench extends across
the spell’s area, and the separated water form s a wall to
either side. The trench rem ains until the spell ends or
you choose a different effect. The water then slowly fills
in the trench over the course of the next round until the
normal water level is restored.
R edirect Flow. You cause flowing water in the area
to move in a direction you choose, even if the water has
to flow over obstacles, up walls, or in other unlikely
directions. The water in the area m oves as you direct
it, but once it m oves beyond the spell’s area, it resum es
its flow based on the terrain conditions. The water
continues to move in the direction you chose until the
spell ends or you choose a different effect.
Whirlpool. This effect requires a body of water
at least 50 feet square and 25 feet deep. You cause
a whirlpool to form in the center of the area. The
whirlpool form s a vortex that is 5 feet w ide at the
base, up to 50 feet w ide at the top, and 25 feet tall. Any
creature or object in the water and within 25 feet of the
vortex is pulled 10 feet toward it. A creature can swim
away from the vortex by m aking a Strength (Athletics)
check against your spell save DC.
When a creature enters the vortex for the first time on
a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Strength
saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d8
bludgeoning damage and is caught in the vortex until
the spell ends. On a successful save, the creature takes
half damage, and isn’t caught in the vortex. A creature
caught in the vortex can use its action to try to swim
away from the vortex as described above, but has
disadvantage on the Strength (Athletics) check to do so.
The first time each turn that an object enters the
vortex, the object takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage; this
damage occu rs each round it rem ains in the vortex.

For the duration, you can read the thoughts of certain
creatures. When you cast the spell and as your action on
each turn until the spell ends, you can focus your mind
on any one creature that you can see within 30 feet of
you. If the creature you ch oose has an Intelligence of
3 or lower or doesn’t speak any language, the creature
is unaffected.
You initially learn the surface thoughts of the
creature—what is most on its mind in that moment. As
an action, you can either shift your attention to another
creature’s thoughts or attempt to probe deeper into the
sam e creature’s mind. If you probe deeper, the target
must make a W isdom saving throw. If it fails, you gain
insight into its reasoning (if any), its emotional state,
and som ething that loom s large in its mind (such as
som ething it w orries over, loves, or hates). If it succeeds,
the spell ends. Either way, the target knows that you are
probing into its mind, and unless you shift your attention
to another creature’s thoughts, the creature can use
its action on its turn to make an Intelligence check
contested by your Intelligence check; if it succeeds,
the spell ends.
Questions verbally directed at the target creature
naturally shape the course of its thoughts, so this spell
is particularly effective as part of an interrogation.
You can also use this spell to detect the presence of
thinking creatures you can’t see. When you cast the
spell or as your action during the duration, you can
search for thoughts within 30 feet of you. The spell can
penetrate barriers, but 2 feet of rock, 2 inches of any
metal other than lead, or a thin sheet of lead blocks you.
You can’t detect a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or
lower or one that doesn’t speak any language.
O nce you detect the presence of a creature in this way,
you can read its thoughts for the rest of the duration as
described above, even if you can’t see it, but it must still
be within range.

Duration: Until dispelled
You touch an object weighing 10 pounds or less w hose
longest dim ension is 6 feet or less. The spell leaves an

If another creature is holding or carrying the item,
crushing the sapphire doesn’t transport the item to you,

Duration: 8 hours
This spell shapes a creature’s dreams. Choose a
creature known to you as the target of this spell. The
target must be on the sam e plane of existence as you.
Creatures that don’t sleep, such as elves, can’t be
contacted by this spell. You, or a willing creature you
touch, enters a trance state, acting as a m essenger.
While in the trance, the m essenger is aware of his or
her surroundings, but can’t take actions or move.
If the target is asleep, the m essenger appears in the
target’s dream s and can converse with the target as
long as it rem ains asleep, through the duration of the
spell. The m essenger can also shape the environment
of the dream, creating landscapes, objects, and other
images. The m essenger can emerge from the trance at
any time, ending the effect of the spell early. The target
recalls the dream perfectly upon waking. If the target is
awake when you cast the spell, the m essenger knows it,
and can either end the trance (and the spell) or wait for
the target to fall asleep, at which point the m essenger
appears in the target’s dreams.
You can make the m essenger appear m onstrous
and terrifying to the target. If you do, the m essenger
can deliver a m essage of no m ore than ten w ords and
then the target must make a W isdom saving throw. On
a failed save, echoes of the phantasmal monstrosity
spawn a nightmare that lasts the duration of the target’s
sleep and prevents the target from gaining any benefit
from that rest. In addition, when the target wakes up, it
takes 3d6 psychic damage.
If you have a body part, lock of hair, clipping from a
nail, or similar portion of the target’s body, the target
m akes its saving throw with disadvantage.

You create a seism ic disturbance at a point on the
ground that you can see within range. For the duration,
an intense trem or rips through the ground in a
100-foot-radius circle centered on that point and shakes
creatures and structures in contact with the ground
in that area.
The ground in the area becom es difficult terrain.
Each creature on the ground that is concentrating must
make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the
creature’s concentration is broken.
When you cast this spell and at the end of each turn
you spend concentrating on it, each creature on the
ground in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw.
On a failed save, the creature is knocked prone.
This spell can have additional effects depending on
the terrain in the area, as determined by the DM.
Fissures. Fissures open throughout the spell’s area at
the start of your next turn after you cast the spell. A total
of 1d6 such fissures open in locations chosen by the DM.
Each is 1d10 x 10 feet deep, 10 feet wide, and extends
from one edge of the spell’s area to the opposite side.
A creature standing on a spot w here a fissure opens
must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall in. A
creature that successfully saves m oves with the fissure’s
edge as it opens.
A fissure that opens beneath a structure causes it to
automatically collapse (see below).
Structures. The tremor deals 50 bludgeoning damage
to any structure in contact with the ground in the area
when you cast the spell and at the start of each of your
turns until the spell ends. If a structure drops to 0 hit
points, it collapses and potentially dam ages nearby
creatures. A creature within half the distance of a
structure’s height must make a Dexterity saving throw.
On a failed save, the creature takes 5d6 bludgeoning
damage, is knocked prone, and is buried in the rubble,
requiring a DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check as an
action to escape. The DM can adjust the DC higher
or lower, depending on the nature of the rubble. On
a successful save, the creature takes half as much
damage and doesn’t fall prone or becom e buried.

You cause a creature or an object you can see within
range to grow larger or smaller for the duration. Choose
either a creature or an object that is neither w orn
nor carried. If the target is unwilling, it can make a
Constitution saving throw. On a success, the spell
has no effect.
If the target is a creature, everything it is w earing and
carrying changes size with it. Any item dropped by an
affected creature returns to norm al size at once.
Enlarge. The target’s size doubles in all dim ensions,
and its weight is multiplied by eight. This growth
increases its size by one category—from M edium to
Large, for example. If there isn’t enough room for the
target to double its size, the creature or object attains
the maximum possible size in the space available.
Until the spell ends, the target also has advantage on
Strength checks and Strength saving throws. The
target’s w eapons also grow to match its new size. While
these weapons are enlarged, the target’s attacks with
them deal 1d4 extra damage.
Reduce. The target’s size is halved in all dim ensions,
and its weight is reduced to one-eighth of normal. This
reduction decreases its size by one category—from
M edium to Small, for example. Until the spell ends,
the target also has disadvantage on Strength checks
and Strength saving throws. The target’s weapons also
shrink to match its new size. While these w eapons are
reduced, the target’s attacks with them deal 1d4 less
damage (this can’t reduce the damage below 1).

You gain the service of a familiar, a spirit that takes an
animal form you choose: bat, cat, crab, frog (toad), hawk,
lizard, octopus, owl, poisonous snake, fish (quipper),
rat, raven, sea horse, spider, or weasel. Appearing in
an unoccupied space within range, the familiar has the
statistics of the chosen form, though it is a celestial, fey,
or fiend (your choice) instead of a beast.
Your familiar acts independently of you, but it always
obeys your com m ands. In combat, it rolls its own
initiative and acts on its own turn. A familiar can’t
attack, but it can take other actions as normal.
When the familiar drops to 0 hit points, it disappears,
leaving behind no physical form. It reappears after you
cast this spell again
While your familiar is within 100 feet of you, you
can com m unicate with it telepathically. Additionally,
as an action, you can see through your fam iliar’s eyes
and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn,
gaining the benefits of any special senses that the
familiar has. During this time, you are deaf and blind
with regard to your ow n senses.
A s an action, you can temporarily dism iss your
familiar. It disappears into a pocket dim ension where it
awaits your sum m ons. Alternatively, you can dism iss it
forever. As an action w hile it is temporarily dismissed,
you can cause it to reappear in any unoccupied space
within 30 feet of you.
You can’t have m ore than one familiar at a time. If you
cast this spell while you already have a familiar, you
instead cause it to adopt a new form. Choose one of the
form s from the above list. Your familiar transforms into
the chosen creature.
Finally, when you cast a spell with a range of touch,
your familiar can deliver the spell as if it had cast the
spell. Your familiar must be within 100 feet of you, and
it must use its reaction to deliver the spell when you cast
it. If the spell requires an attack roll, you use your attack
modifier for the roll.

You place a magical com m and on a creature that you
can see within range, forcing it to carry out som e
service or refrain from som e action or course of activity
as you decide. If the creature can understand you, it
must succeed on a W isdom saving throw or becom e
charm ed by you for the duration. While the creature
is charm ed by you, it takes 5 d10 psychic damage
each time it acts in a manner directly counter to your
instructions, but no m ore than once each day. A creature
that can't understand you is unaffected by the spell.
You can issue any com m and you choose, short of an
activity that would result in certain death. Should you
issue a suicidal com m and, the spell ends.
You can end the spell early by using an action to
dism iss it. A remove curse, greater restoration, or wish
spell also ends it.
A t H igher Levels. When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 7th or 8th level, the duration is 1 year.
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 9th level,
the spell lasts until it is ended by one of the spells
mentioned above.

3rd-level abjuration
Casting Time: 1 hour
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M (incense and pow dered diamond
worth at least 200 gp, which the spell consum es)
Duration: Until dispelled or triggered
When you cast this spell, you inscribe a glyph that
harms other creatures, either upon a surface (such as
a table or a section of floor or wall) or within an object
that can be closed (such as a book, a scroll, or a treasure
chest) to conceal the glyph. If you choose a surface, the
glyph can cover an area of the surface no larger than
10 feet in diameter. If you choose an object, that object
must remain in its place; if the object is m oved m ore
than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is
broken, and the spell ends without being triggered.
The glyph is nearly invisible and requires a successful
Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save
DC to be found.
You decide what triggers the glyph w hen you cast
the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most
typical triggers include touching or standing on the
glyph, removing another object covering the glyph,
approaching within a certain distance of the glyph, or
manipulating the object on which the glyph is inscribed.
For glyphs inscribed within an object, the m ost com m on
triggers include opening that object, approaching within
a certain distance of the object, or seeing or reading the
glyph. O nce a glyph is triggered, this spell ends.
You can further refine the trigger so the spell activates
only under certain circum stances or according to
physical characteristics (such as height or weight),
creature kind (for example, the ward could be set to
affect aberrations or drow), or alignment. You can also
set conditions for creatures that don’t trigger the glyph,
such as those w ho say a certain password.
When you inscribe the glyph, choose explosive runes
or a spell glyph.
Explosive Runes. When triggered, the glyph erupts
with m agical energy in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered
on the glyph. The sphere spreads around corners. Each
creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving
throw. A creature takes 5d8 acid, cold, fire, lightning, or
thunder damage on a failed saving throw (your choice
when you create the glyph), or half as much damage on a
successful one.
Spell Glyph. You can store a prepared spell of
3rd level or lower in the glyph by casting it as part
of creating the glyph. The spell must target a single
creature or an area. The spell being stored has no
immediate effect w hen cast in this way. When the glyph
is triggered, the stored spell is cast. If the spell has a
target, it targets the creature that triggered the glyph.
If the spell affects an area, the area is centered on
that creature. If the spell sum m ons hostile creatures
or creates harmful objects or traps, they appear as
close as possible to the intruder and attack it. If the
spell requires concentration, it lasts until the end of its
full duration.
A t Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage of an
explosive runes glyph increases by 1d8 for each slot
level above 3rd. If you create a spell glyph, you can store
any spell of up to the sam e level as the slot you use for
the glyph of warding.

You create a ward that protects up to 2,500 square feet
of floor space (an area 50 feet square, or one hundred
5-foot squares or twenty-five 10-foot squares). The
warded area can be up to 20 feet tall, and shaped as you
desire. You can ward several stories of a stronghold by
dividing the area am ong them, as long as you can walk
into each contiguous area while you are casting the spell.
When you cast this spell, you can specify individuals
that are unaffected by any or all of the effects that
you choose. You can also specify a passw ord that,
when spoken aloud, makes the speaker immune to
these effects.
Guards and wards creates the following effects within
the warded area.
Corridors. Fog fills all the warded corridors, making
them heavily obscured. In addition, at each intersection
or branching passage offering a choice of direction,
there is a 50 percent chance that a creature other than
you will believe it is going in the opposite direction from
the one it chooses.
Doors. All doors in the warded area are magically
locked, as if sealed by an arcane lock spell. In addition,
you can cover up to ten doors with an illusion (equivalent
to the illusory object function of the minor illusion spell)
to make them appear as plain sections of wall.
Stairs. W ebs fill all stairs in the warded area from top
to bottom, as the web spell. These strands regrow in 10
minutes if they are burned or torn away while guards
and wards lasts.
Other Spell Effect. You can place your choice of one
of the following m agical effects within the warded area
of the stronghold.
• Place dancing lights in four corridors. You can designate a simple program that the lights repeat as long as
guards and wards lasts.
• Place magic mouth in two locations.
• Place stinking cloud in two locations. The vapors
appear in the places you designate; they return within
10 minutes if dispersed by w ind while guards and
wards lasts.
• Place a constant gust of wind in one corridor or room .
• Place a suggestion in one location. You select an area
of up to 5 feet square, and any creature that enters
or passes through the area receives the suggestion
mentally.
The whole warded area radiates magic. A dispel
magic cast on a specific effect, if successful, removes
only that effect.
You can create a permanently guarded and warded
structure by casting this spell there every day
for one year.

statuette in the likeness of the target, and a special
com ponent that varies according to the version of the
spell you choose, worth at least 500 gp per Hit Die
of the target)
Duration: Until dispelled
You create a magical restraint to hold a creature that
you can see within range. The target must succeed on
a W isdom saving throw or be bound by the spell; if it
succeeds, it is im mune to this spell if you cast it again.
While affected by this spell, the creature doesn't need
to breathe, eat, or drink, and it doesn’t age. Divination
spells can’t locate or perceive the target.
When you cast the spell, you choose one of the
following form s of imprisonment.
Burial. The target is entombed far beneath the earth
in a sphere of magical force that is just large enough to
contain the target. Nothing can pass through the sphere,
nor can any creature teleport or use planar travel to get
into or out of it.
The special com ponent for this version of the spell is a
small mithral orb.
Chaining. Heavy chains, firmly rooted in the ground,
hold the target in place. The target is restrained until
the spell ends, and it can’t move or be moved by any
means until then.
The special com ponent for this version of the spell is a
fine chain of precious metal.
Hedged Prison. The spell transports the target into
a tiny demiplane that is warded against teleportation
and planar travel. The demiplane can be a labyrinth, a
cage, a tower, or any similar confined structure or area
of your choice.
The special com ponent for this version of the spell is a
miniature representation of the prison made from jade.
Minimus Containment. The target shrinks to a height
of 1 inch and is im prisoned inside a gem stone or similar
object. Light can pass through the gemstone normally
(allowing the target to see out and other creatures to see
in), but nothing else can pass through, even by means of
teleportation or planar travel. The gemstone can’t be cut
or broken while the spell rem ains in effect.
The special com ponent for this version of the spell
is a large, transparent gemstone, such as a corundum ,
diamond, or ruby.
Slumber. The target falls asleep and can’t be awoken.
The special com ponent for this version of the spell
consists of rare soporific herbs.
Ending the Spell. During the casting of the spell,
in any of its versions, you can specify a condition that
will cause the spell to end and release the target. The
condition can be as specific or as elaborate as you
choose, but the DM must agree that the condition is
reasonable and has a likelihood of com ing to pass. The
conditions can be based on a creature’s name, identity,
or deity but otherwise must be based on observable
actions or qualities and not based on intangibles such as
level, class, or hit points.
A dispel magic spell can end the spell only if it is cast
as a 9th-level spell, targeting either the prison or the
special com ponent used to create it.
You can use a particular special com ponent to create
only one prison at a time. If you cast the spell again
using the sam e com ponent, the target of the first casting
is immediately freed from its binding.

6 th-level necromancy
Casting Time: 1 minute
Range: Self
Components: V, S, M (a gem, crystal, reliquary, or som e
other ornamental container worth at least 500 gp)
Duration: Until dispelled
Your body falls into a catatonic state as your soul leaves
it and enters the container you used for the spell’s
material component. While your soul inhabits the
container, you are aware of your surroundings as if you
w ere in the container’s space. You can’t move or use
reactions. The only action you can take is to project your
soul up to 100 feet out of the container, either returning
to your living body (and ending the spell) or attempting
to possess a hum anoids body.
You can attempt to possess any humanoid within
100 feet of you that you can see (creatures warded by a
protection from evil and good or magic circle spell can’t
be possessed). The target must make a Charisma saving
throw. On a failure, your soul m oves into the target’s
body, and the target’s soul becom es trapped in the
container. On a success, the target resists your efforts
to possess it, and you can’t attempt to possess it again
for 24 hours.
Once you possess a creature’s body, you control it.
Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the
creature, though you retain your alignment and your
Intelligence, W isdom , and Charisma scores. You retain
the benefit of your own class features. If the target has
any class levels, you can’t use any of its class features.
Meanwhile, the possessed creature’s soul can
perceive from the container using its own senses, but it
can’t move or take actions at all.
While possessing a body, you can use your action to
return from the host body to the container if it is within
100 feet of you, returning the host creature’s soul to
its body. If the host body dies while you’re in it, the
creature dies, and you must make a Charisma saving
throw against your ow n spellcasting DC. On a success,
you return to the container if it is within 100 feet of you.
Otherwise, you die.
If the container is destroyed or the spell ends, your
soul immediately returns to your body. If your body is
m ore than 100 feet away from you or if your body is
dead w hen you attempt to return to it, you die. If another
creature’s soul is in the container when it is destroyed,
the creature’s soul returns to its body if the body is alive
and within 100 feet. Otherwise, that creature dies.
When the spell ends, the container is destroyed.

Components: V, S, M (a small bit of honeycom b

Duration: Until dispelled
You implant a m essage within an object in range, a
m essage that is uttered when a trigger condition is met.
Choose an object that you can see and that isn’t being
w orn or carried by another creature. Then speak the
m essage, which must be 25 w ords or less, though it
can be delivered over as long as 10 minutes. Finally,
determine the circum stance that will trigger the spell to
deliver your m essage.
When that circum stance occurs, a m agical mouth
appears on the object and recites the m essage in your
voice and at the same volume you spoke. If the object
you chose has a mouth or som ething that looks like a
mouth (for example, the mouth of a statue), the magical
mouth appears there so that the w ords appear to com e
from the object’s mouth. When you cast this spell, you
can have the spell end after it delivers its m essage, or
it can remain and repeat its m essage whenever the
trigger occurs.
The triggering circum stance can be as general or as
detailed as you like, though it must be based on visual
or audible conditions that occur within 30 feet of the
object. For example, you could instruct the mouth to
speak when any creature m oves within 30 feet of the
object or w hen a silver bell rings within 30 feet of it.

3rd-level illusion
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 120 feet
Components: V, S, M (a bit of fleece)
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
You create the image of an object, a creature, or som e
other visible phenom enon that is no larger than a
20-foot cube. The image appears at a spot that you
can see within range and lasts for the duration. It
seem s completely real, including sounds, smells, and
temperature appropriate to the thing depicted. You
can’t create sufficient heat or cold to cause damage, a
sound loud enough to deal thunder damage or deafen a
creature, or a smell that might sicken a creature (like a
troglodyte’s stench).
A s long as you are within range of the illusion, you
can use your action to cause the image to m ove to
any other spot within range. As the im age changes
location, you can alter its appearance so that its
m ovements appear natural for the image. For example,
if you create an im age of a creature and move it, you
can alter the im age so that it appears to be walking.
Similarly, you can cause the illusion to make different
sounds at different times, even making it carry on a
conversation, for example.
Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an
illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature
that uses its action to examine the image can determine
that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence
(Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a
creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature
can see through the image, and its other sensory
qualities becom e faint to the creature.

You suggest a course of activity (limited to a sentence

of your choice that you can see within range and that
can hear and understand you. Creatures that can’t be

itself, throw itself onto a spear, immolate itself, or do
som e other obviously harmful act automatically negates
the effect of the spell.
Each target must make a W isdom saving throw. On a
failed save, it pursues the course of action you described
to the best of its ability. The suggested course of action
can continue for the entire duration. If the suggested
activity can be com pleted in a shorter time, the spell

You can also specify conditions that will trigger a

You step into a stone object or surface large enough to

Using your movement, you step into the stone at a point
you can touch. Nothing of your presence remains visible

otherwise can’t move.
Minor physical damage to the stone doesn’t harm
you, but its partial destruction or a change in its shape
(to the extent that you no longer fit within it) expels you
and deals 6d6 bludgeoning damage to you. The stone’s
complete destruction (or transmutation into a different

You create a sound or an image of an object within

If you create a sound, its volum e can range from a

You make terrain in an area up to 1 mile square
look, sound, smell, and even feel like som e other sort
of terrain. The terrain’s general shape remains the
same, however. Open fields or a road could be made to
resem ble a swamp, hill, crevasse, or som e other difficult
or im passable terrain. A pond can be made to seem like
a grassy meadow, a precipice like a gentle slope, or a
rock-strewn gully like a wide and sm ooth road.
Similarly, you can alter the appearance of structures,
or add them where none are present. The spell doesn’t
disguise, conceal, or add creatures.
The illusion includes audible, visual, tactile, and
olfactory elements, so it can turn clear ground into
difficult terrain (or vice versa) or otherwise im pede
movement through the area. Any piece of the illusory
terrain (such as a rock or stick) that is removed from the
spell’s area disappears immediately.
Creatures with truesight can see through the illusion
to the terrain’s true form; however, all other elements
of the illusion remain, so while the creature is aware of
the illusion’s presence, the creature can still physically
interact with the illusion.

Each time a creature targets you with an attack during
the spell’s duration, roll a d20 to determine whether the

two duplicates, you must roll an 8 or higher. With one
duplicate, you must roll an 11 or higher.
A duplicate’s AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier.

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
You attempt to reshape another creature’s m em ories.
One creature that you can see must make a W isdom
saving throw. If you are fighting the creature, it has
advantage on the saving throw. On a failed save, the
target becom es charm ed by you for the duration. The
charm ed target is incapacitated and unaware of its
surroundings, though it can still hear you. If it takes any
damage or is targeted by another spell, this spell ends,
and none of the target’s m em ories are modified.
While this charm lasts, you can affect the target’s
m em ory of an event that it experienced within the last
24 hours and that lasted no m ore than 10 minutes. You
can permanently eliminate all m em ory of the event,
allow the target to recall the event with perfect clarity
and exacting detail, change its m em ory of the details of
the event, or create a m em ory of som e other event.
You must speak to the target to describe how
its m em ories are affected, and it must be able to
understand your language for the modified m em ories to
take root. Its mind fills in any gaps in the details of your
description. If the spell ends before you have finished
describing the m odified m em ories, the creature’s
m em ory isn’t altered. Otherwise, the modified m em ories
take hold w hen the spell ends.
A m odified m em ory doesn’t necessarily affect how a
creature behaves, particularly if the m em ory contradicts
the creature’s natural inclinations, alignment, or beliefs.
An illogical modified memory, such as implanting a
m em ory of how much the creature enjoyed dousing
itself in acid, is dism issed, perhaps as a bad dream. The
DM might deem a modified m em ory too nonsensical to
affect a creature in a significant manner.
A remove curse or greater restoration spell cast on the
target restores the creature’s true memory.

slot of 6th level or higher, you can alter the target’s
m em ories of an event that took place up to 7 days ago
(6th level), 30 days ago (7th level), 1 year ago (8th level),
or any time in the creature’s past (9th level).

security the spell provides, choosing any or all of the
following properties:
• Sound can't pass through the barrier at the edge of
the warded area.
• The barrier of the warded area appears dark and foggy,
preventing vision (including darkvision) through it.
• Sensors created by divination spells can’t appear
inside the protected area or pass through the barrier
at its perimeter.
• Creatures in the area can’t be targeted by divination
spells.
• Nothing can teleport into or out of the warded area.
• Planar travel is blocked within the warded area.
Casting this spell on the same spot every day for a
year makes this effect permanent.
A t Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can increase the size
of the cube by 100 feet for each slot level beyond 4th.
Thus you could protect a cube that can be up to 200 feet
on one side by using a spell slot of 5th level.

Duration: Concentration, up to 2 hours
Choose an area of terrain no larger than 40 feet on a
side within range. You can reshape dirt, sand, or clay
in the area in any m anner you choose for the duration.
You can raise or lower the area’s elevation, create or fill
in a trench, erect or flatten a wall, or form a pillar. The
extent of any such changes can’t exceed half the area’s

you can create a pillar up to 20 feet high, raise or lower
the square’s elevation by up to 20 feet, dig a trench up
to 20 feet deep, and so on. It takes 10 minutes for these
changes to complete.
At the end of every 10 minutes you spend
concentrating on the spell, you can choose a new area of
terrain to affect.
Because the terrain’s transformation occurs slowly,
creatures in the area can’t usually be trapped or injured
by the ground’s movement.
This spell can’t manipulate natural stone or
stone construction. R ocks and structures shift to
accom m odate the new terrain. If the way you shape
the terrain w ould make a structure unstable, it
might collapse.
Similarly, this spell doesn’t directly affect plant

Range: 300 feet
Components: V, S, M (a small crystal sphere)
Duration: Instantaneous
A frigid globe of cold energy streaks from your fingertips
to a point of your choice within range, where it explodes
in a 60-foot-radius sphere. Each creature within the
area must make a Constitution saving throw. On a
failed save, a creature takes 10d6 cold damage. On a
successful save, it takes half as much damage.
If the globe strikes a body of water or a liquid that is
principally water (not including water-based creatures),
it freezes the liquid to a depth of 6 inches over an area
30 feet square. This ice lasts for 1 minute. Creatures
that w ere sw im m ing on the surface of frozen water are

You can refrain from firing the globe after completing
the spell, if you wish. A small globe about the size of
a sling stone, cool to the touch, appears in your hand.
At any time, you or a creature you give the globe to
can throw the globe (to a range of 40 feet) or hurl it
with a sling (to the sling’s norm al range). It shatters

Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
A sphere of shim m ering force encloses a creature
or object of Large size or sm aller within range. An
unwilling creature must make a Dexterity saving
throw. On a failed save, the creature is enclosed for
the duration.
Nothing—not physical objects, energy, or other spell
effects—can pass through the barrier, in or out, though
a creature in the sphere can breathe there. The sphere
is immune to all damage, and a creature or object inside
can’t be damaged by attacks or effects originating from
outside, nor can a creature inside the sphere damage
anything outside it.
The sphere is w eightless and just large enough to

2nd-level illusion
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S, M (a bit of fleece)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
You craft an illusion that takes root in the mind of a
creature that you can see within range. The target must
make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, you
create a phantasmal object, creature, or other visible
phenom enon of your choice that is no larger than a
10-foot cube and that is perceivable only to the target
for the duration. This spell has no effect on undead
or constructs.
The phantasm includes sound, temperature, and other
stimuli, also evident only to the creature.
The target can use its action to examine the phantasm
with an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your
spell save DC. If the check succeeds, the target realizes
that the phantasm is an illusion, and the spell ends.
While a target is affected by the spell, the target treats
the phantasm as if it were real. The target rationalizes
any illogical outcom es from interacting with the
phantasm. For example, a target attempting to walk
across a phantasmal bridge that spans a chasm falls
once it steps onto the bridge. If the target survives the
fall, it still believes that the bridge exists and com es up
with som e other explanation for its fall—it w as pushed,
it slipped, or a strong wind might have knocked it off.
An affected target is so convinced of the phantasm’s
reality that it can even take damage from the illusion. A
phantasm created to appear as a creature can attack the
target. Similarly, a phantasm created to appear as fire, a
pool of acid, or lava can burn the target. Each round on
your turn, the phantasm can deal 1d6 psychic damage
to the target if it is in the phantasm’s area or within 5
feet of the phantasm, provided that the illusion is of a
creature or hazard that could logically deal damage,
such as by attacking. The target perceives the damage
as a type appropriate to the illusion.

6th-level conjuration
Casting Time: 10 minutes
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
You beseech an otherworldly entity for aid. The being
must be known to you: a god, a primordial, a dem on
prince, or som e other being of cosm ic power. That entity
sends a celestial, an elemental, or a fiend loyal to it to
aid you, making the creature appear in an unoccupied
space within range. If you know a specific creature’s
name, you can speak that name w hen you cast this spell
to request that creature, though you might get a different
creature anyway (D M ’s choice).
When the creature appears, it is under no com pulsion
to behave in any particular way. You can ask the
creature to perform a service in exchange for payment,
but it isn’t obliged to do so. The requested task could
range from simple (fly us across the chasm, or help us
fight a battle) to com plex (spy on our enemies, or protect
us during our foray into the dungeon). You must be
able to com m unicate with the creature to bargain for
its services.
Payment can take a variety of forms. A celestial might
require a sizable donation of gold or m agic items to
an allied temple, while a fiend might demand a living
sacrifice or a gift of treasure. S om e creatures might
exchange their service for a quest undertaken by you.
As a rule of thumb, a task that can be m easured in
minutes requires a payment worth 100 gp per minute. A
task m easured in hours requires 1,000 gp per hour. And
a task m easured in days (up to 10 days) requires 10,000
gp per day. The DM can adjust these payments based on
the circum stances under which you cast the spell. If the
task is aligned with the creature’s ethos, the payment
might be halved or even waived. Nonhazardous tasks
typically require only half the suggested payment, while
especially dangerous tasks might require a greater gift.
Creatures rarely accept tasks that seem suicidal.
After the creature com pletes the task, or when the
agreed-upon duration of service expires, the creature
returns to its hom e plane after reporting back to you,
if appropriate to the task and if possible. If you are
unable to agree on a price for the creature’s service, the
creature immediately returns to its hom e plane.
A creature enlisted to join your group counts as
a m em ber of it, receiving a full share of experience
points awarded.

With this spell, you attempt to bind a celestial, an

must be within range for the entire casting of the spell.
(Typically, the creature is first sum m oned into the center
of an inverted magic circle in order to keep it trapped
while this spell is cast.) At the com pletion of the casting,
the target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a
failed save, it is bound to serve you for the duration. If
the creature w as sum m oned or created by another spell,
that spell’s duration is extended to match the duration
of this spell.
A bound creature must follow your instructions to the
best of its ability. You might com m and the creature to
accom pany you on an adventure, to guard a location, or
to deliver a m essage. The creature obeys the letter of
your instructions, but if the creature is hostile to you, it
strives to twist your w ords to achieve its own objectives.
If the creature carries out your instructions completely
before the spell ends, it travels to you to report this fact
if you are on the sam e plane of existence. If you are on a

you bound it and rem ains there until the spell ends.

You and up to eight willing creatures who link hands in

You can specify a target destination in general terms,
such as the City of Brass on the Elemental Plane of

If you are trying to reach the City of Brass, for example,
you might arrive in its Street of Steel, before its Gate of

Alternatively, if you know the sigil sequence of a
teleportation circle on another plane of existence, this
spell can take you to that circle. If the teleportation
circle is too small to hold all the creatures you
transported, they appear in the closest unoccupied
spaces next to the circle.
You can use this spell to banish an unwilling creature
to another plane. Choose a creature within your reach
and make a melee spell attack against it. On a hit, the
creature must make a Charisma saving throw. If the

This spell transforms a creature that you can see

must make a W isdom saving throw to avoid the
effect. A shapechanger automatically succeeds on this
saving throw.
The transformation lasts for the duration, or until
the target drops to 0 hit points or dies. The new form
can be any beast w hose challenge rating is equal to or
less than the target’s (or the target’s level, if it doesn't
have a challenge rating). The target’s game statistics,
including mental ability scores, are replaced by the
statistics of the chosen beast. It retains its alignment

The target assum es the hit points of its new form.
When it reverts to its norm al form, the creature
returns to the number of hit points it had before it
transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to
0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its
normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn’t
reduce the creature’s norm al form to 0 hit points, it isn’t

The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by
the nature of its new form, and it can’t speak, cast spells,

P r i s m a t i c  W a l l
9th-level abjuration
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: 10 minutes
A shim mering, m ulticolored plane of light form s a
vertical opaque wall—up to 90 feet long, 30 feet high,
and 1 inch thick—centered on a point you can see
within range. Alternatively, you can shape the wall into
a sphere up to 30 feet in diameter centered on a point
you choose within range. The wall remains in place for
the duration. If you position the wall so that it passes
through a space occupied by a creature, the spell fails,
and your action and the spell slot are wasted.
The wall sheds bright light out to a range of 100
feet and dim light for an additional 100 feet. You and
creatures you designate at the time you cast the spell
can pass through and remain near the wall without
harm. If another creature that can see the wall m oves to
within 20 feet of it or starts its turn there, the creature
must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or becom e
blinded for 1 minute.
The wall consists of seven layers, each with a different
color. When a creature attempts to reach into or pass
through the wall, it does so one layer at a time through
all the w all’s layers. As it passes or reaches through
each layer, the creature must make a Dexterity saving
throw or be affected by that layer’s properties as
described below.
The wall can be destroyed, also one layer at a time, in
order from red to violet, by m eans specific to each layer.
Once a layer is destroyed, it remains so for the duration
of the spell. A rod of cancellation destroys a prismatic
wall, but an antimagic field has no effect on it.
1. Red. The creature takes 10d6 fire damage on a
failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
While this layer is in place, nonm agical ranged attacks
can’t pass through the wall. The layer can be destroyed
by dealing at least 25 cold damage to it.
2. Orange. The creature takes 10d6 acid damage on
a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful
one. While this layer is in place, m agical ranged attacks
can’t pass through the wall. The layer is destroyed by
a strong wind.
3. Yellow. The creature takes 10d6 lightning damage
on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful
one. This layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 60
force damage to it.
4. Green. The creature takes 10d6 poison damage on
a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful
one. A passwall spell, or another spell of equal or
greater level that can open a portal on a solid surface,
destroys this layer.
5. Blue. The creature takes 10d6 cold damage on a
failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
This layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 25 fire
damage to it.
6. Indigo. On a failed save, the creature is restrained.
It must then make a Constitution saving throw at the
end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves three
times, the spell ends. If it fails its save three times,
it permanently turns to stone and is subjected to the
petrified condition. The successes and failures don’t
need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the
creature collects three of a kind.
While this layer is in place, spells can’t be cast
through the wall. The layer is destroyed by bright light
shed by a daylight spell or a similar spell of equal or
higher level.
7. Violet. On a failed save, the creature is blinded. It
must then make a W isdom saving throw at the start of
your next turn. A successful save ends the blindness. If
it fails that save, the creature is transported to another
plane of the DM ’s choosing and is no longer blinded.
(Typically, a creature that is on a plane that isn’t its
hom e plane is banished hom e, while other creatures
are usually cast into the Astral or Ethereal planes.) This
layer is destroyed by a dispel magic spell or a similar
spell of equal or higher level that can end spells and
m agical effects.

6th-level illusion
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 120 feet
Components: V, S, M (a bit of fleece and jade dust worth
at least 25 gp)
Duration: Until dispelled
You create an illusion of an object, a creature, or
som e other visible phenom enon within range that
activates when a specific condition occurs. The illusion
is imperceptible until then. It must be no larger than a
30-foot cube, and you decide when you cast the spell
how the illusion behaves and what sounds it makes. This
scripted perform ance can last up to 5 minutes.
When the condition you specify occurs, the illusion
springs into existence and perform s in the manner you
described. O nce the illusion finishes perform ing, it
disappears and remains dormant for 10 minutes. After
this time, the illusion can be activated again.
The triggering condition can be as general or as
detailed as you like, though it must be based on visual or
audible conditions that occu r within 30 feet of the area.
For example, you could create an illusion of yourself
to appear and warn off others w ho attempt to open a
trapped door, or you could set the illusion to trigger only
when a creature says the correct w ord or phrase.
Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an
illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature
that uses its action to exam ine the image can determine
that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence
(Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a
creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature
can see through the image, and any noise it m akes
sounds hollow to the creature.

You create an illusory copy of yourself that lasts for

within range that you have seen before, regardless of
intervening obstacles. The illusion looks and sounds
like you but is intangible. If the illusion takes any
damage, it disappears, and the spell ends.
You can use your action to move this illusion up to

behave in whatever way you choose. It m im ics your

You can see through its eyes and hear through its
ears as if you were in its space. On your turn as a bonus
action, you can switch from using its senses to using
your own, or back again. While you are using its senses,
you are blinded and deafened in regard to your own

You return a dead creature you touch to life, provided
that it has been dead no longer than 10 days. If the
creature’s soul is both willing and at liberty to rejoin the
body, the creature returns to life with 1 hit point.
This spell also neutralizes any poisons and cures
nonm agical diseases that affected the creature at the
time it died. This spell doesn’t, however, remove magical
diseases, curses, or similar effects; if these aren’t first
removed prior to casting the spell, they take effect when
the creature returns to life. The spell can’t return an
undead creature to life.
This spell closes all mortal w ounds, but it doesn’t
restore m issing body parts. If the creature is lacking
body parts or organs integral for its survival—its head,
for instance—the spell automatically fails.
Com ing back from the dead is an ordeal. The target

5th-level illusion
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: 8 hours
This spell allows you to change the appearance of any
number of creatures that you can see within range. You
give each target you ch oose a new, illusory appearance.
An unwilling target can make a Charisma saving throw,
and if it succeeds, it is unaffected by this spell.
The spell disguises physical appearance as well as
clothing, armor, w eapons, and equipment. You can make
each creature seem 1 foot shorter or taller and appear
thin, fat, or in between. You can’t change a target’s body
type, so you must choose a form that has the same
basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of
the illusion is up to you. The spell lasts for the duration,
unless you use your action to dism iss it sooner.
The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to
physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell
to add a hat to a creature’s outfit, objects pass through
the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing
or w ould feel the creature’s head and hair. If you use
this spell to appear thinner than you are, the hand of
som eone w ho reaches out to touch you w ould bump into
you while it w as seem ingly still in midair.

Duration: 1 round
You send a short m essage of twenty-five w ords or

You can send the m essage across any distance and
even to other planes of existence, but if the target is on a

it becom es invisible and can’t be targeted by divination

The condition can be anything you choose, but it
must occu r or be visible within 1 mile of the target.
Exam ples include “after 1,000 years” or “when the

cast the spell)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
You assume the form of a different creature for the
duration. The new form can be of any creature with
a challenge rating equal to your level or lower. The
creature can’t be a construct or an undead, and you
must have seen the sort of creature at least once. You
transform into an average example of that creature, one
without any class levels or the Spellcasting trait.
Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics
of the chosen creature, though you retain your
alignment and Intelligence, W isdom , and Charisma
scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving
throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the
creature. If the creature has the sam e proficiency as you
and the bonus listed in its statistics is higher than yours,
use the creature’s bonus in place of yours. You can’t use
any legendary actions or lair actions of the new form.
You assume the hit points and Hit D ice of the new
form. When you revert to your normal form, you
return to the number of hit points you had before you
transformed. If you revert as a result of dropping to
0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your
norm al form. As long as the excess damage doesn’t
reduce your norm al form to 0 hit points, you aren’t
knocked unconscious.
You retain the benefit of any features from your class,
race, or other source and can use them, provided that
your new form is physically capable of doing so. You
can’t use any special senses you have (for example,
darkvision) unless your new form also has that sense.
You can only speak if the creature can normally speak.
When you transform, you choose whether your
equipment falls to the ground, m erges into the new
form, or is w orn by it. W orn equipment functions as
normal. The DM determines whether it is practical for
the new form to w ear a piece of equipment, based on
the creature’s shape and size. Your equipment doesn’t
change shape or size to match the new form, and any
equipment that the new form can’t w ear must either fall
to the ground or merge into your new form. Equipment
that m erges has no effect in that state.
During this spell’s duration, you can use your action to
assume a different form following the sam e restrictions
and rules for the original form, with one exception: if
your new form has more hit points than your current
one, your hit points remain at their current value.

You can use your action to cause the image to m ove to

you can alter its appearance so that its movements
appear natural for the image. For example, if you create
an im age of a creature and move it, you can alter the
im age so that it appears to be walking.
Physical interaction with the im age reveals it to be an
illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature

that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence

You shape an illusory duplicate of one beast or

It appears to be the sam e as the original, but it has half

The simulacrum is friendly to you and creatures you

If the creature attempts to cast a spell with a casting

to it or it recognizes you as an enemy. This spell doesn’t
return the creature’s soul to its body, only its animating
spirit. Thus, the corpse can’t learn new information,

ordinary terrain where plants are present into difficult

Plants might be able to perform other tasks on your

7th-level abjuration
Casting Time: 1 minute
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M (mercury, phosphorus, and
pow dered diam ond and opal with a total value of at
least 1,000 gp, which the spell consum es)
Duration: Until dispelled or triggered
When you cast this spell, you inscribe a harmful glyph
either on a surface (such as a section of floor, a wall, or
a table) or within an object that can be closed to conceal
the glyph (such as a book, a scroll, or a treasure chest).
If you choose a surface, the glyph can cover an area of
the surface no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If you
choose an object, that object must remain in its place; if
the object is moved m ore than 10 feet from where you
cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends
without being triggered.
The glyph is nearly invisible, requiring an Intelligence
(Investigation) check against your spell save
DC to find it.
You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the
spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical
triggers include touching or stepping on the glyph,
removing another object covering it, approaching within
a certain distance of it, or manipulating the object
that holds it. For glyphs inscribed within an object,
the most com m on triggers are opening the object,
approaching within a certain distance of it, or seeing or
reading the glyph.
You can further refine the trigger so the spell is
activated only under certain circum stances or according
to a creature’s physical characteristics (such as height
or weight), or physical kind (for example, the ward could
be set to affect hags or shapechangers). You can also
specify creatures that don’t trigger the glyph, such as
those w ho say a certain password.
When you inscribe the glyph, choose one of the
options below for its effect. Once triggered, the glyph
glows, filling a 60-foot-radius sphere with dim light
for 10 minutes, after which time the spell ends. Each
creature in the sphere when the glyph activates is
targeted by its effect, as is a creature that enters the
sphere for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.
Death. Each target must make a Constitution saving
throw, taking 10d 10 necrotic damage on a failed save, or
half as much damage on a successful save.
Discord. Each target must make a Constitution saving
throw. On a failed save, a target bickers and argues
with other creatures for 1 minute. During this time,
it is incapable of meaningful com m unication and has
disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.
Fear. Each target must make a W isdom saving throw
and becom es frightened for 1 minute on a failed save.
While frightened, the target drops whatever it is holding
and must move at least 30 feet away from the glyph on
each of its turns, if able.
H opelessness. Each target must make a Charisma
saving throw. On a failed save, the target is
overwhelm ed with despair for 1 minute. During this
time, it can’t attack or target any creature with harmful
abilities, spells, or other magical effects.
Insanity. Each target must make an Intelligence saving
throw. On a failed save, the target is driven insane for
1 minute. An insane creature can’t take actions, can't
understand what other creatures say, can’t read, and
speaks only in gibberish. The DM controls its movement,
which is erratic.
Pain. Each target must make a Constitution saving
throw and becom es incapacitated with excruciating pain
for 1 minute on a failed save.
Sleep. Each target must make a W isdom saving throw
and falls unconscious for 10 minutes on a failed save. A
creature awakens if it takes damage or if som eone uses
an action to shake or slap it awake.
Stunning. Each target must make a W isdom saving
throw and becom es stunned for 1 minute on a failed save.

Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
You gain the ability to move or manipulate creatures
or objects by thought. When you cast the spell, and as
your action each round for the duration, you can exert
your will on one creature or object that you can see
within range, causing the appropriate effect below. You
can affect the same target round after round, or choose
a new one at any time. If you switch targets, the prior
target is no longer affected by the spell.
Creature. You can try to move a Huge or smaller
creature. Make an ability check with your spellcasting
ability contested by the creature’s Strength check. If
you win the contest, you move the creature up to 30 feet
in any direction, including upward but not beyond the
range of this spell. Until the end of your next turn, the
creature is restrained in your telekinetic grip. A creature
lifted upward is suspended in mid-air.
On subsequent rounds, you can use your action to
attempt to maintain your telekinetic grip on the creature
by repeating the contest.
Object. You can try to move an object that weighs
up to 1,000 pounds. If the object isn’t being w orn or
carried, you automatically move it up to 30 feet in any
direction, but not beyond the range of this spell.
If the object is w orn or carried by a creature, you must
make an ability check with your spellcasting ability
contested by that creature’s Strength check. If you
succeed, you pull the object away from that creature and
can move it up to 30 feet in any direction but not beyond
the range of this spell.
You can exert fine control on objects with your
telekinetic grip, such as manipulating a simple tool,
opening a door or a container, stowing or retrieving
an item from an open container, or pouring the
contents from a vial.

Familiarity. “Permanent circle” m eans a permanent
teleportation circle w hose sigil sequence you know.
“Associated object” m eans that you possess an object
taken from the desired destination within the last six
months, such as a book from a w izard’s library, bed
linen from a royal suite, or a chunk of marble from a
lich’s secret tomb.
“Very familiar” is a place you have been very often, a
place you have carefully studied, or a place you can see
when you cast the spell. “Seen casually” is som eplace
you have seen m ore than once but with w hich you aren’t
very familiar. “Viewed on ce” is a place you have seen
once, possibly using magic. “D escription” is a place
w hose location and appearance you know through
som eone else’s description, perhaps from a map.
“False destination” is a place that doesn’t exist.
Perhaps you tried to scry an enem y’s sanctum but
instead viewed an illusion, or you are attempting to
teleport to a familiar location that no longer exists.
On Target. You and your group (or the target object)
appear where you want to.
O ff Target. You and your group (or the target object)
appear a random distance away from the destination
in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10 x
1d10 percent of the distance that was to be traveled.
For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off
target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d 10s, then you
would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The DM
determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a
d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east,
and so on around the points of the com pass. If you were
teleporting to a coastal city and w ound up 18 m iles out
at sea, you could be in trouble.
Similar Area. You and your group (or the target
object) wind up in a different area that’s visually or
thematically similar to the target area. If you are
heading for your hom e laboratory, for example, you
might wind up in another w izard’s laboratory or in
an alchem ical supply shop that has many of the same
tools and implements as your laboratory. Generally,
you appear in the closest similar place, but since the
spell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up
anywhere on the plane.
Mishap. The spell’s unpredictable magic results in a
difficult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the target
object) takes 3d10 force damage, and the DM rerolls on
the table to see where you wind up (multiple mishaps
can occur, dealing damage each time).

Duration: 1 round
As you cast the spell, you draw a 10-foot-diameter
circle on the ground inscribed with sigils that link
your location to a permanent teleportation circle of

portal opens within the circle you drew and remains
open until the end of your next turn. Any creature that
enters the portal instantly appears within 5 feet of the
destination circle or in the nearest unoccupied space if
that space is occupied.
Many m ajor temples, guilds, and other important
places have permanent teleportation circles inscribed
som ewhere within their confines. Each such circle
includes a unique sigil sequence—a string of magical
runes arranged in a particular pattern. When you first
gain the ability to cast this spell, you learn the sigil
sequences for two destinations on the Material Plane,
determined by the DM. You can learn additional sigil

You can create a permanent teleportation circle by

year. You need not use the circle to teleport when you
cast the spell in this way.

Choose one creature or nonm agical object that you

a different creature, the creature into an object, or the
object into a creature (the object must be neither worn
nor carried by another creature). The transformation
lasts for the duration, or until the target drops to 0 hit
points or dies. If you concentrate on this spell for the full

Shapechangers aren’t affected by this spell. An

Creature into Creature. If you turn a creature into
another kind of creature, the new form can be any kind
you choose w hose challenge rating is equal to or less
than the target’s (or its level, if the target doesn’t have a
challenge rating). The target’s game statistics, including
mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of
the new form. It retains its alignment and personality.
The target assum es the hit points of its new form,
and when it reverts to its normal form, the creature
returns to the number of hit points it had before it
transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to
0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its
norm al form. As long as the excess damage doesn’t
reduce the creature’s norm al form to 0 hit points, it isn’t
knocked unconscious.
The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by
the nature of its new form, and it can’t speak, cast spells,
or take any other action that requires hands or speech
unless its new form is capable of such actions.
The target’s gear melds into the new form. The
creature can’t activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit
from any of its equipment.
O bject into Creature. You can turn an object into
any kind of creature, as long as the creature’s size
is no larger than the object’s size and the creature’s
challenge rating is 9 or lower. The creature is friendly to
you and your com panions. It acts on each of your turns.
You decide what action it takes and how it moves. The
DM has the creature’s statistics and resolves all of its
actions and movement.
If the spell becom es permanent, you no longer control
the creature. It might remain friendly to you, depending
on how you have treated it.
Creature into Object. If you turn a creature into an
object, it transforms along with whatever it is wearing
and carrying into that form. The creature’s statistics
becom e those of the object, and the creature has no
m em ory of time spent in this form, after the spell ends
and it returns to its norm al form.

Once on each of your turns as a bonus action, you can
mentally com m and the servant to move up to 15 feet and
interact with an object. The servant can perform simple
tasks that a human servant could do, such as fetching
things, cleaning, mending, folding clothes, lighting
fires, serving food, and pouring wine. Once you give the
com m and, the servant perform s the task to the best of
its ability until it com pletes the task, then waits for your
next com m and.
If you com m and the servant to perform a task that
w ould move it m ore than 60 feet away from you,
the spell ends.

Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
An invisible wall of force springs into existence at a
point you choose within range. The wall appears in
any orientation you choose, as a horizontal or vertical
barrier or at an angle. It can be free floating or resting
on a solid surface. You can form it into a hemispherical

can shape a flat surface made up of ten 10-foot-by-
10-foot panels. Each panel must be contiguous with
another panel. In any form, the wall is 1/4 inch thick.
It lasts for the duration. If the wall cuts through a

You create a wall of ice on a solid surface within range.
You can form it into a hemispherical dom e or a sphere
with a radius of up to 10 feet, or you can shape a flat
surface made up of ten 10-foot-square panels. Each
panel must be contiguous with another panel. In any
form, the wall is 1 foot thick and lasts for the duration.
If the wall cuts through a creature’s space when it
appears, the creature within its area is pushed to one
side of the wall and must make a Dexterity saving throw.
On a failed save, the creature takes 10d6 cold damage,
or half as much damage on a successful save.
The wall is an object that can be damaged and thus
breached. It has AC 12 and 30 hit points per 10-foot
section, and it is vulnerable to fire damage. Reducing
a 10-foot section of wall to 0 hit points destroys it and
leaves behind a sheet of frigid air in the space the wall
occupied. A creature moving through the sheet of frigid
air for the first time on a turn must make a Constitution
saving throw. That creature takes 5d6 cold damage on a
failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Range: 120 feet
Components: V, S, M (a small block of granite)
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
A nonm agical wall of solid stone springs into existence
at a point you choose within range. The wall is 6 inches
thick and is com posed of ten 10-foot-by-10-foot panels.
Each panel must be contiguous with at least one other
panel. Alternatively, you can create 10-foot-by-20-foot
panels that are only 3 inches thick.
If the wall cuts through a creature’s space when it
appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall
(your choice). If a creature w ould be surrounded on all
sides by the wall (or the wall and another solid surface),
that creature can make a Dexterity saving throw. On a
success, it can use its reaction to move up to its speed so
that it is no longer enclosed by the wall.
The wall can have any shape you desire, though it
can’t occupy the sam e space as a creature or object.
The wall doesn’t need to be vertical or rest on any firm
foundation. It must, however, merge with and be solidly
supported by existing stone. Thus, you can use this spell
to bridge a chasm or create a ramp.
If you create a span greater than 20 feet in length, you
must halve the size of each panel to create supports.
You can crudely shape the wall to create crenellations,
battlements, and so on.
The wall is an object made of stone that can be
dam aged and thus breached. Each panel has AC 15 and
30 hit points per inch of thickness. Reducing a panel
to 0 hit points destroys it and might cause connected
panels to collapse at the DM ’s discretion.
If you maintain your concentration on this spell for
its whole duration, the wall becom es permanent and
can’t be dispelled. Otherwise, the wall disappears when
the spell ends.

You conjure a m ass of thick, sticky webbing at a point of

from that point for the duration. The w ebs are difficult
terrain and lightly obscure their area.
If the w ebs aren’t anchored between two solid m asses

spell ends at the start of your next turn. W ebs layered
over a flat surface have a depth of 5 feet.
Each creature that starts its turn in the w ebs or that
enters them during its turn must make a Dexterity

as long as it remains in the w ebs or until it breaks free.
A creature restrained by the w ebs can use its action to
make a Strength check against your spell save DC. If it

9th-level conjuration
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self
Components: V
Duration: Instantaneous
Wish is the mightiest spell a mortal creature can
cast. By simply speaking aloud, you can alter the very
foundations of reality in accord with your desires.
The basic use of this spell is to duplicate any other
spell of 8th level or lower. You don’t need to meet any
requirements in that spell, including costly com ponents.
The spell simply takes effect.
Alternatively, you can create one of the following
effects of your choice:
• You create one object of up to 25,000 gp in value that
isn’t a m agic item. The object can be no m ore than
300 feet in any dimension, and it appears in an unoccupied space you can see on the ground.
• You allow up to twenty creatures that you can see to
regain all hit points, and you end all effects on them
described in the greater restoration spell.
• You grant up to ten creatures that you can see resistance to a damage type you choose.
• You grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to
a single spell or other magical effect for 8 hours. For
instance, you could m ake yourself and all your com panions im mune to a lich’s life drain attack.
• You undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of
any roll made within the last round (including your
last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accom m odate the
new result. For example, a wish spell could undo an
opponent’s successful save, a foe’s critical hit, or a
friend’s failed save. You can force the reroll to be made
with advantage or disadvantage, and you can choose
whether to use the reroll or the original roll.
You might be able to achieve som ething beyond the
scope of the above examples. State your wish to the DM
as precisely as possible. The DM has great latitude in
ruling what occu rs in such an instance; the greater the
wish, the greater the likelihood that som ething goes
wrong. This spell might simply fail, the effect you desire
might only be partly achieved, or you might suffer som e
unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded
the wish. For example, wishing that a villain w ere dead
might propel you forward in time to a period when that
villain is no longer alive, effectively removing you from
the game. Similarly, w ishing for a legendary m agic item
or artifact might instantly transport you to the presence
of the item’s current owner.
The stress of casting this spell to produce any effect
other than duplicating another spell w eakens you. After
enduring that stress, each time you cast a spell until
you finish a long rest, you take 1d10 necrotic damage
per level of that spell. This damage can’t be reduced or
prevented in any way. In addition, your Strength drops
to 3, if it isn’t 3 or lower already, for 2d4 days. For each
of those days that you spend resting and doing nothing
m ore than light activity, your remaining recovery time
decreases by 2 days. Finally, there is a 33 percent
chance that you are unable to cast wish ever again if you
suffer this stress.
